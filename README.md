### Rendering
* The App will render a navigationbar initially.
* The navigationbar will contain two elements-Homepage and secondpage.
### Functioning
* When the homepage is clicked, the client sends a request to the server running on port-9000(locahost:9000/).
* When the secondpage is clicked, the client sends a request to the server running on port-9000(locahost:9000/second).
* Then sets the data coming from the server into the variable 'data'.
* Then the data is renderd in the page.
